Other values for emissions indicate "Dummy" emissions that are merely used to limit the activity of certain technologies.
Examples are:
HO: hydro power
SO: solar pv
WI: wind power
WO: In the model version in this repo it is not included, but in other versions it is the limit for offshore wind, if so WI covers only onshore wind.
